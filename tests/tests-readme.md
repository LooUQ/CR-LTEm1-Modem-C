# LTEmC Tests

LooUQ provides a series of tests to validate basic LTEmC operations. These are used by LooUQ internally to evaluate "porting" efforts to new MCU/framework targets. They can also be useful for troubleshooting issues encountered during device application development. The current suite of 4 tests go from basic GPIO/SPI validation up to full interrupt based command execution.

There is a user focus suite of "examples" for common use-case scenarios to assist you with accelerating your IoT project/product. These are found in the **\examples** folder.


## ltemc-01-platform
This test performs a continuous loop of I/O operations to verify GPIO mapping and SPI basic functionality.
